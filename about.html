        educational power and efficiency. The first half of the course is often described as “drinking from 
        a firehose” because of how much information it packs in. In the second half, you use your new coding 
        skills to build projects while learning new technology on the fly. By the end, you will be an expert 
        software engineer, capable of tackling unique and unfamiliar problems as well as building complex applications.</em></p>
