                The RBK immersive program is an advanced coding bootcamp focused on building autonomous software 
                engineers ready for any job in the tech industry. Every unit in our curriculum is optimized for 
                educational power and efficiency. The first half of the course is often described as “drinking from 
                a firehose” because of how much information it packs in. In the second half, you use your new coding 
                skills to build projects while learning new technology on the fly. By the end, you will be an expert 
                software engineer, capable of tackling unique and unfamiliar problems as well as building complex applications.

                Our immersive program is a coding bootcamp focused on producing self-contained software developers
                 ready for any job in the technology industry. Each part of our program is optimized for effective 
                 and efficient education. The first half of the course is often described as “drinking from a fire 
                 hydrant” because of the amount of information it contains. In the second half, you will use your
                  new coding skills to create projects while learning new technologies on the fly. In the end, you’ll be an expert 
                  software developer, able to handle unique and unknown problems as well as create complex applications.
